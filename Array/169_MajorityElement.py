'''
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

# Approach: 
# Iterate through the array, maintain a count of occurrences for each element in the dictionary. 
# If the count for any element exceeds ⌊n / 2⌋, return that element as the majority element.

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums)==1:
            return nums[0]
        d={}
        for num in nums:
            if num in d:
                d[num]+=1
                if d[num]>len(nums)//2:
                    return num
            else:
                d[num]=1
