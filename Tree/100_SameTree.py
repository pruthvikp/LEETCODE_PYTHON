'''
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Example 1:
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false

Constraints:
The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104
'''

# Approach:
# Check the base case: if both trees are null, return true.
# Check if only one tree is null or the values of the current nodes are different, return false.
# Recursively check if the left subtrees of both trees are identical.
# Recursively check if the right subtrees of both trees are identical.
# Return the logical AND of the results from above two steps

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def isSameTree(self, p, q):
        """
        :type p: TreeNode
        :type q: TreeNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if p is None and q is None:
            return True
        if p is None or q is None:
            return False
        if p.val!=q.val:
            return False
        return self.isSameTree(p.left,q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right,q.right)
